GATSBY: “I’m afraid it is. I’m sorry, I should have told you earlier, I just…”
DAISY: “I don’t need to hear anymore. We’re done.”
GATSBY: “Daisy, no, I promise it’s not like that. I’m not a bad person, I swear, it’s just my job…”
DAISY: “No, Gatsby. You’re a liar. You’ve lied to me for the past five years. I have to go.”

You have failed.
