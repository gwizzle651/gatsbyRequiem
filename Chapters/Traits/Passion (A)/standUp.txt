You give Gatsby a boost of confidence.
GATSBY: “No, Daisy, he’s lying. He’s lying because he’s afraid, because he’s starting to see the truth, that we were the ones really meant to be together, and he’s been in the wrong this whole time…”
Tom breaks a bottle over the back of Gatsby’s head. Daisy gasps, Nick and Jordan recoil.
TOM: “I’m sorry… it had to be done. He was a criminal. We need to leave, now.”
DAISY: “No. I’m not going anywhere with you. He might’ve been a criminal, but you’re a killer. Goodbye, Tom.”
You have failed.
GAME OVER
