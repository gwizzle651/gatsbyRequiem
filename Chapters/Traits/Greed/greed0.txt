???: “Do you know why I wanted to meet with you today, Mr. {name}?”
{name}: “Not sure, old sport, but if you want to talk business I’m happy to oblige”
???: “My name is WOLFSHEIM. Meyer WOLFSHEIM. I have a proposal to make”

{name}: “I’d say all of those things are true. What do you need me for?”
WOLFSHEIM: “I need your help in some matters of utmost confidentiality. Before I disclose more information, I need to know if I can trust you to keep this between the two of us.”
{name}: “Now, old sport, this isn’t something… criminal, is it?”
WOLFSHEIM: “I’m afraid that the business I’m asking you to partake in might involve some extralegal affairs”
