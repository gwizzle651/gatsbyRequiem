You give Gatsby a boost of confidence.
Gatsby breaks Tom’s grip, then breaks his nose. Tom staggers backwards, utterly shocked. A small fight ensues, ending with Gatsby as the winner.
GATSBY: “Let’s go home, Daisy. I think your husband needs some time alone.”
The five depart the hotel in silence. While driving Daisy home, Gatsby accidentally strikes and kills Tom’s mistress, Myrtle. A day later, Gatsby is shot dead at his pool by George Wilson, her widower.
You have failed.
GAME OVER
