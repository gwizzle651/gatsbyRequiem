The smell of blood and rage fills the air.
Bullets scream over a once-green pasture
A man casually breaks a woman’s nose
A car recklessly speeds down the highway
Grief
An autumn day… a pool… no, not there.
Not yet.
A quiet dock
GATSBY approaches TOM.
The thoughts are no longer quiet.
GATSBY: “How are things, old sport?”
TOM: “Fine, just fine. Absolutely fine. DAISY’s just off God-knows-where, doing God-knows-what, while I’m out here chinning with you. What is it you wanted me for, anyway?”
GATSBY: “Well, old sport, there’s something I’ve gotta tell you.”
“DAISY doesn’t love you anymore.”
TOM starts, and turns towards GATSBY, confused.
GATSBY: “She never loved you, TOM. She loves me. She’s always loved me.”
TOM’s face flushes with anger, and he stands up.
TOM: “You take that back right now, you pompous…”
TOM collapses as GATSBY breaks a bottle over his head.
GATSBY hefts the body, then dumps it into the water.
Blood and wine stain his skin and clothing.
He is complete in this act of violence.
This is what could happen.
No, this is what will happen.
If you do not act.
A red THING coalesces out of the bay.
This is what you are meant to fight.
It reaches out to you.
You know what you have to do.
